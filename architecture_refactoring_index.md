# Architecture Refactoring Documentation Index

## Overview
This directory contains several documents related to the architecture refactoring of the Data Analyzer application. The goal is to migrate from a monolithic structure to a Flask Application Factory pattern with Blueprints.

## Documents

### 1. Analysis Documents
- [Architecture Analysis](architecture_analysis.md) - Detailed analysis of current implementation vs. proposed architecture
- [Redundancy Removal Plan](redundancy_removal_plan.md) - Identification and plan to remove redundancies in the codebase

### 2. Implementation Plans
- [Implementation Plan](implementation_plan.md) - Phased approach to complete the migration
- [Template Update Plan](templates_update_plan.md) - Plan for updating templates to work with blueprint routes
- [Architecture Migration Summary](architecture_migration_summary.md) - Summary of current status and next steps

### 3. Implementation Scripts
- [replace_app_py.py](replace_app_py.py) - Script to safely replace app.py with the modified version

## Progress Made

### Completed
- Added `clear_session_data()` to `app/utils.py`
- Updated `app/auth/routes.py` to use the utility function
- Migrated ticker validation functions from `modules/routes/home.py` to `app/utils.py`
- Updated `modules/routes/home.py` to use the consolidated utility functions
- Created modified app.py with authentication routes removed
- Created script to safely replace app.py with the modified version

### Next Steps
1. Run the replacement script to replace app.py with app_modified.py
2. Update admin templates to use blueprint routes
3. Move error handlers from app.py to app/__init__.py
4. Continue with the remaining tasks in the implementation plan

## Testing Instructions

After each phase:
1. Run the application using `python run.py`
2. Test login/logout functionality
3. Test admin user management
4. Test ticker analysis functionality
5. Verify all templates are rendering correctly
